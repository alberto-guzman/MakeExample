# LabNotes for Assignment 6

### Author: Alberto Guzman-Alvarez

What follows are the steps I took to create the .html report:

1. Collected all parts of the report + figure
2. Created a Makefile to generate the .html report

- Used cat to merge all sections of the report together into a .md file
- Used the pandoc command to generate the .html report from the .md file

### To replicate my report please do the following steps:

1. Clone my repo to get the most up to date code

   `git clone myrepo https://github.com/alberto-guzman/MakeExample.git `

2. Change directory to myrepo
   `cd MakeExample`

3. Run Makefile to generate .html report
   `Make`
